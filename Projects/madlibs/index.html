  <h3>WVACS Activites
    7.14 </h3>
  <p>
    We did not lose anyone this trip! We had several <span class="word">ordinal number (first, second, etc.)</span>-time cavers and everyone had fun and skittered up the <span class="word">noun</span> pole when exiting at the <span class="word">Name
      1 </span> entrance. A bit of excitement occured when <span class="word">Name 2</span> tripped and contacted a <span class="word">type of rock</span> fin with the bridge of their <span class="word">body part</span>. <span class="word">Name 3</span>
    had <span class="word"> item found in a cave pack (plural)</span> so <span class="word">Name 2</span> was soon fixed up with no worries. Thanks for going on the trip!

  <h3>
    <span class="word">County Name</span> County <span class="word">Type of Animal</span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    After seeing a picture on a <span class="word">electronic device</span>, <span class="word">Name</span> spent several hours over the <span class="word">holiday</span> weekend fishing for a <span class="word">number</span>-foot-long <span class="word">Animal
      (same as before)</span> in the Tygart Valley <span class="word">type of body of water</span>. He was finally able to hook it on <span class="word">day of the week</span> <span class="word">time of day</span> and said, "It put up a pretty <span
      class="word">adjective</span> fight. It was was snapping at anything and everything. It definitely would have bit you, if it could have got ahold of you. It was sure big enough to take a finger off, and it was <span class="word">adjective</span>-
    really <span class="word">adjective (same as before)</span>." 911 was <span class="word">verb (past tense)</span> and wildife officials from <span class="word">Name of City</span> transported the <span class="word">Animal
      (same as before)</span> to <span class="word">Name of Town</span> to be part of the <span class="word">name of tourist attraction</span> outdoor wildlife program. There was no word on where exactly on the <span class="word">body of water
      (same as before)</span> the <span class="word">Animal
      (same as before)</span> was caught.

  <h3>Unexpected High Water</h3>
  <p>
    Friday, September 7th, 2018:
    <span class="word">Name 1</span> and I had planned to meet Carl Admundson and Keely Owens at the cave entrance at our usual entry time of <span class="word">number (between 1 and 12)</span> PM. While driving to <span class="word">Name of State</span>,
    Carl had become sick and decided to turn around and head home, notifying us a few hours before that they would not be joining us. Our three-person team entered at <span class="word">number (between 1 and 12)</span>:30 PM. We found the <span
      class="word">type of animal</span> Hole mainly dry, filled with <span class="word">food</span>-like mud. We made it to <span class="word">noun</span> Camp in a respectable time and set it up to <span class="word">verb</span>.
    Saturday, September 8th:
    During the middle of the night, around <span class="word">number (between 1 and 12)</span> AM, I awoke to water noises. I turned on my <span class="word">noun</span> and put on my glasses to find that the <span class="word">noun</span> Hole in
    camp was flowing<span class="word">type of liquid</span>! Earlier that evening, we had noted that <span class="word">same liquid</span> had flowed through camp recently, as a high-<span class="word">same liquid</span> line was evident. The <span
      class="word">same liquid</span> quickly rose, starting to fill the Vanishing
    <span class="word">type of body of water</span>, trying to separate us from the exit, making camp an island. I was beat, so I decided to head back to bed as <span class="word">Name 1</span> and Keely were up and had their <span class="word">body
      part</span> on the situation. They stayed up for another hour or <span class="word">number</span>, monitoring the <span class="word">same liquid</span>, making sure that in case we had to abandon camp we could do so quickly. At one point, the
    <span class="word">same liquid</span> started to rise near Keely's sleeping area, so she moved to higher ground, to <span class="word">Name 2</span>'s usual spot. Fortunately, the <span class="word">same liquid</span> water did not enter the
    room quicker than it could drain, so camp did not flood up to our sleeping bags.

  <h3> Cave-Hollow Arbogast August 18th, 2018</h3>
  <p>
    [Reprinted from the July-August 2018 Potomac Caver V61n4p9.] <br />
    <span class="word">Name 1</span> carpooled with Karen Willmes and me to the <span class="word">name of hotel</span>. We checked in and had a tasty meal and after a good breakfast on <span class="word">day of the week</span>, were off the the
    cave.
    Karen and I have a new <span class="word">electronic device</span> that was calibrated for <span class="word">Name of State</span>, which we ran on our <span class="word">adjective</span> course to check backsights. It checked out fine. We got
    the cave and began the challenge of opening the <span class="word">noun</span>. <span class="word">Name 1</span> got the ock off soon enough, but we had difficulty in getting the bar in position to allow entry. <span class="word">verb ending in
      -ing</span> with this for a bit, we finally did get the thing open.

    We entered the cave for the first survey trip into Cave Hollow proper for at least <span class="word">number</span> years. As we needed to avoid disturbing the small maternity colony of Virginia big-eared <span class="word">type of animal
      (plural)</span>, we walked silently to the first stream junction while avoiding shining our lights at the ceiling. We observed a <span class="word">another type of animal</span>, as we continued walking upstream. While it resembled a cave
    salamander, it was a lighter shade of <span class="word">color</span> and had smaller spots. It was probably a <span class="word">adjective</span>-tailed salamander.
    <br />
    . . .
    <br />
    We wrapped up the survey and returned to the entrance to again wrestle with the <span class="word">noun (same as earlier)</span>. We discovered that my <span class="word">body part</span>. does not fit into the area one needs to reattach the
    lock. It is a bit <span class="word">adjective</span>, but my <span class="word">body part (same as before)</span> just does not bend that way. <span class="word">Name 1</span> got the lock back on, but couldn't get it to actually lock.
    Fortunately, Karen's <span class="word">body part</span> is smaller and she succeeded in locking the lock. <span class="word">Name 1</span> <span class="word">verb (past tense)</span> it to ensure success. We then returned to the <span class="word">type
      of vehicle</span> and ultimately to dinner at <span class="word">name of restaurant</span>. We had added another <span class="word">number</span> and surved a tad over <span class="word">number</span> feet of cave. <span class="word">Number</span>
    and a half hours portal to portal, with almost half of that being travel time to and from the cave.
    It was a <span class="word">adjective</span> trip.
